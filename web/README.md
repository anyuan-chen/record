working version of the records API to function.

To use, first configure a .env file. You must include the url at which the REST API
microservice is located in order to start the application.

The env variable should be of the following format:
SERVER_URL=yoururlhere

In the project directory, you can run:
```bash

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
